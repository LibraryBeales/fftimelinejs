Approximately 1.6 million patients undergo interhospital transfer (IHT) each year in the United States. Of those IHT's, approximately 550,000 are conducted by air1 (i.e., helicopters or jets), or roughly one every 60 seconds, at an estimated annual cost of $6 billion. 2 Contrary to common belieft, patients who undergo IHT experience worse outcomes, which include double the length of stay, twice the cost, and higher mortality than non-transferred patients. 3,4 Our preliminary work suggests that transfer by air has little to no impact on morbidity or mortality. THe industry has been entrenched in these transport practices for decades, requiring broader approaches such as changing reimbursement practices that may ultimately influence changes in practice that will reduce costs while maintaining patient safety and outcomes. 

The goal of this exploratory project is to pair existing state and national databases of patient hospitalizations and associated medical transfers with geographical information systems (GIS) mapping technology to develop a robust analysis tool to support health policy efforts. ",,,,,,,

Each summer, from 2012-2019, the PRCHN has employed a small army of student to conduct in-store audits in nearly 2,000 retail outlets across the city that sell food and/or tobacco, including supermarkets, large and small grocers, corner stores and convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, bars and fast food outlets. This data has been disseminated by PRCHN researchers through limited maps and presentations, as well as being linked with participants from other research studies interested in proximity of healthy/unhealthy food and tobacco products. However, in its current form, it's not easily shared and requires more technical assistance than the PRCHN can often provide. MOreover, to be more useful to community and public health partners, more informative food environment indices need to be developed. THus, we seek to work with the Freedman Center to make the database more available to our community partners and research collaborators, in a form that is informative, accessible, and user friendly. Our ultimate deliverable is a clean, longitudinal database, available in different formats that can be accessed for map layers, geospatial analyses, and analytic projects, which will be made available through a platform easily accessible by community and public health partners and fellow researchers.

This project implements database design and GIS software to offer a digital study of the movement of Cleveland's Jewish congregations over space and time (from when Jewish immigrants first arrvied in the area in the mid 19th century until today). In tandem, the project uses Freedman Center hardware and software to provide a visual study of trends in preserving and re-locating synagogues' sacred bits (such as stained glass windows, Torah arks, and memorial palques), as the congregations have moved. Based on preliminary research conducted for my book, ""Preserving and Disposing of the Sacred : America's Jewish Congregations"" (under contract with Penn State University Press) I suggest that congregations that congregations which moved out of urban centers into the suburbs following World War II where inspired by modernist aesthetic and optimism about Judaism's place in the American landscape. This pilot sutdy is situated in the Cleveland metropolitan region, and is desifned to develop best-practices for colleticing, organizing and comparing data on a national scale. Celveland offers a wonderful place to beign for many reasons, includign the fact that it is close to home and easy to access (particularly importnat in the midst of this COVID era). In addition (1) the number of existing synagogue congregations in the metropolitan area (approximately 20) offers a manageable group to study over the course of a year (2) greater-Cleveland's Jewish population is highly compact, with almost all current in-use synagogue buildings occupying a region of only a few square miles, making comparison easy to manage and (3) the history of Cleveland's synagogues has beend well-studied and documentated in secondary sources, and is easy to access",,,,,,,

This project will apply digital tools and methods to model, study, and understand socio-legal responses to the spread of COVID-19 - in particular, emergency measures that derogate from states' human rights commitments. This moment is a rare opportunity to study human rights derogation in response to public emergencies across multiple societies over the sma time period. In response to COVID-19, over twenty national governments have instituted de jure derogations, and over 100 national governments have instituted de facto derogation. These circumstances demonstrated the neccessity of developing new approaches to studying derogation of human rights,. National governments sometimes suspend human rights when an emergency doe snot exist or the emergency is long over. Derogation domino effects raise concerns for durability and legitimavy of democracy and democratic accountability. ",,,,,,,

The recent challenges of teaching stage combat and theatrical movement online has created a scramble to find answers for long-distance solo training in physically interactive disciplines. What I'd like to investigate is the potential for VR training content, viwed through affordable headsets. I believe this could be a better delivery medium for instruction in things like theatrical swordplay, creating a better kinesthetic response in viewers, and eliminating the need to mentally adjust for perspective or angle. Since targets and attacks are all done relative to one's scene partner, a first-person perspective could be invaluable, and the ability to look around and check the position of feet, hips, blades etc. will help resolve some of the queations students might otherwise have.

It is not always easy to be difficult. Behavioral experiments in cognitive science suggest that there are two big, enduring roadblocks to our efforts to be ""cooperatively uncooperative,"" cooperating with others as much as, but no more than, we would like. How do people navigate these complex challenges in paractice? How do these challenges shape our interactions, relationships, and creative endeavors? People who want to be difficult in this speacial way (which is, surprixingly often, all of us) need strategies to circumvent elements to their cognition that work agist them. We look at these strategies as performances of applied cognitive science in the wild. We will collect case studies of people who make a professional avocational practice of navigating these special projects, and share them with the public as a series of podcast episodes and transcripts of the complete interviews as well as of the podcast epiodies.

2021,,,,,,,,,Enhancing Teacher Communication Through Objective Facial Affect and Gaze Analysis,"The art and science of teaching music relies upon the ability of educators to emote both expressivity and intent. Given the nature of muscial performance, direct verbal instractuion is often not possible and the enducator must rely upon facial affect, jesture, and gaze to elict the intended behavioral and musicla responses. However, many future teachers struggle to reconcile the disparity between intended and displayed nonverbal signals (Scherber, Darrow, Veronee, in press).. To combat this disparity, young educators are often asked to review video recordings of their teaching demonstrations to identify potential issues. However, without objective gudiance or detailed analysis of affect, jesture, and gaze, these future teachers may struggle to understand how to imporvet their skillset. In this tudy, I plan to supplement traditional instruction with Noldus Face Reader software. Via an algorithm (Cootes and Taylor, 2000), FaceReader analyzes 500 key points in facial expressions to determine affect classification (e.g. happy vs. sad), valence (specturm of positive to negative), and arousal (e.g. active vs. inactive). This obejctive and highly-specific feedback provided by the software may assist students to better understand content and more quickly improve their skills. As usic teachers with strong nonverbal communication have been found to be more effective (Johnson, Darrow, & Eason, 2008), this remains important element of  teacher education curriculum. As such, I believe future music educators who recieve consistent obejctive and specific feedback via FaceReader will be better prepared for their future career. ",,,,,,,

Although it is widely known that ""Cleveland rocks,"" the aim of this project is to show that ""Cleveland swings."" The rich history of jaxx in the city is not widely understood, but it is extensive. THroughout my ethnographic research of the Cleveland jaxx scene, I frequently found that today's jaxx musicians look upon Cleveland's Jaxx past with nostalgia, a golden age of music in the city. Furthermore, during my Freedman Fellow project ""Right Before Rock,"" I documented a list of more than 5- venues where jazz was performed in the city. In the project, I will map the history of Cleveland's Jazz venues - with a particular focus in the Univeristy Circle area - using ArcGIS. Referred to as Cleveland's ""second downtown,"" the area boasted numerous jaxx clubs beginning around mid-centur: the alhambra, The Twone Casino, The Jaxx Temple, Club 100, Cotton Club and numerous tohers. Cleveland trumpet palyer Kenny Davis once described jazz in the Univerisy Circle area as ""a smaller version of NewYork's 52nd Street."" By mapping venues, this project wekks to illuminate a lost musical landscape. It also seeks to show how the jazz scene reached its peak in the 1950s and declined into the late 1960s. Additonally, the project seeks to digitize newpaper articles and other documentation that points to the jazz cultural heritage of the city, as well as on the campus of CWRU. In fact, it will feature a 1963 campus map printed in the CWRU paper (The Case Tech, Volume LVIV, Number 1) that includes The Jazz Temple. Beyond this focus on the landscape of the scne,e I also intend to undertake interviews with two legendary Cleveland Jazz musicians who emerged from this scene: Grammy award-winner Joe Lavano and legednary organist Eddie Baccus Sr. By discussing the past with these two musicians, I will add a textured contextual understanding to Cleveland's shifting musical landscape.

Who was in Ganhi's ""social network"" at different stages in his political career? What might his shifting social networks reveal about his evolving politics? This porject quantifies and categorizes Ganhi's various ""instances of communication"" to network/visualize Gandhi's social networks. In doing so, I hope to critically analyze the racial, gender, national and class character of his networks while also considering the key thinkers (ideas) of his network. As part of this updated focus, I will also continue to focus on my initial proposal: building and interactive network resource on Gandhi that gives scholars a visual way to expolre how activist ideas spread and to see what has - or hasn't - been studied in the extant historiography on Gandhi, India, and nonviolence.
